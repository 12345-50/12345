## Windows Security Warning
-------------------------
If Windows shows a warning like:
- "Windows protected your PC"

Don't worry! This is a normal Windows security feature called SmartScreen.

To fix this:

1. Right-click on the downloaded file or the extracted executable.
2. Choose **Properties**.
3. At the bottom of the Properties window, check the box labeled **Unblock**.
4. Click **Apply** and then **OK**.
5. Now, try running the game again by double-clicking the executable.

## If You Cannot Download the File Because of Browser or Windows Blocking

Sometimes browsers like Google Chrome or Windows Defender may block the download or delete it automatically. If you cannot download or keep the file, try this:

1. Open **Windows Security** (search for it from the Start menu).
2. Go to **Virus & threat protection**.
3. Click **Protection history**.
4. Find the blocked download (e.g., `Minesweeper.exe` or the archive file).
5. Click on the item and choose **"Allow on device"**.
6. After this, try downloading the file from GitHub again.
