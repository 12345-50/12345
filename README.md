## ▶️ How to Run

1. Extract **all files** from the archive (`.exe`, `.dll`, `.ttf`) into the **same folder**.
2. Double-click the `Minesweeper.exe` file to start the game.
3. No installation is needed — just **extract and run**!

## ⚠️ Windows Security Warning

When running the game for the first time, Windows may show a warning such as:
- "Windows protected your PC"
- "This file might be unsafe"

This happens because the game is **not digitally signed**, which is common for small indie projects.

### 👉 To run anyway:

**Option 1: Unblock manually**
1. Right-click the `.exe` file.
2. Select **Properties**.
3. Check the box that says **"Unblock"** (if visible) at the bottom.
4. Click **Apply**, then **OK**.
5. Double-click the `.exe` again.

**Option 2: Through the SmartScreen popup**
1. When the SmartScreen warning appears, click **More info**.
2. Then click **Run anyway**.

## 📁 Important Notes

- Keep all files (`.exe`, `.dll`, `.ttf`) in the **same folder** — they are required to run the game.
- If your browser (like Chrome) blocks the download:
  - Go to `chrome://downloads`
  - Click **"Keep dangerous file"** → **"Keep anyway"**
